## Determination of blast radius of the meteorite blast that created the lake bosomtwe using PostGIS

Lake Bosumtwi is the only natural lake in Ghana. It is situated within an
ancient impact crater that is about 10.5 kilometres in diameter. 
The impact is estimated to be 1.07 million years old (Pleistocene period).
The blast radius resulting from an asteroid
impact is generally much larger than the actual crater size. The blast radius depends on
several factors, including the size and velocity of the asteroid, the angle of impact, and
the type of terrain it strikes. For a rough estimation, the blast radius can be about 10 to
20 times the crater diameter.
